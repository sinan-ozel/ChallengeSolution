# Challenge Solution

This Jupyter notebook should be easy to read, and should demonstrate ability to work with PySpark using the Spark SQL and the Spark DataFrame APIs.

It should be easy to read, including comments showing stream-of-thought, and fairly clean code.

## To Replicate

Other than the challenge files, the only file needed is the one Jupyter notebook in the repo.

Unzip the challenge itself in a Windows 10 computer with WinPython, Spark and PySpark installed with the relevant environmental variables set up.

Put the Jupyter notebook in the same folder.

Run the Jupyter notebook from beginning to the end.
